Like a dumb actor in the dumb charades game, this program will enact graphically(without sound) or display the verbose text which highly HINTS the movie title (but does not contain it in anyway), make it easier for the user to guess it. The program will use an actor (a stick figure) -- intelligent agent -- which acts in graphical mode and prints sentences in verbose/command-line mode.

A degree project-work-in-progress by 3 Symbians :)
