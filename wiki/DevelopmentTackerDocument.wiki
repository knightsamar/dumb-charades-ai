Following software have been installed for setting up the server environment. The server environment is Linux based.<br/>
1. [http://www.python.org/download/ Python 2.5]<br/>
2. [http://www.nltk.org/download Natural Language Toolkit]<br/>
3. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy NumPy] - Numerical Python adds a fast and sophisticated array facility to the Python language. NumPy is the most recent and most actively supported package.<br/>
4. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/ MatPlotLib] - Matplotlib is a pure python plotting library with the goal of making publication quality plots using a syntax familiar to matlab users. The library uses numpy for handling large data sets and supports a variety of output backends<br/>
5. [http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/ Prover9] - Prover9 is an automated theorem prover for first-order and equational logic, and Mace4 searches for finite models and counter examples.<br/>
6. [http://pybrain.org/ PyBrain] - 

----
=== Python 2.5 ===
One can compile the source code for Python 2.5. For debian systems, type following command<br/>

`sudo apt-get install python`<br/><br/>



=== Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) ===
Obtain the zip file from [http://nltk.googlecode.com/files/nltk-0.9.8.zip here]. Extract and install the toolkit by running `setup.py`<br/><br/>



=== NumPy - ===
`sudo apt-get install python-numpy` -- debian based systems<br/>
Download and compile the tar.gz for others<br/><br/>



=== MatPlotLib ===
`sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib` -- debian based systems<br/>
Download and compile the tar.gz for others.<br/><br/>


=== Prover9 ===
`sudo apt-get install prover9` -- debian based systems<br/>
Download the tar.gz [http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Emccune/prover9/gui/p9m4-v05.tar.gz here] and compile it.<br/><br/>

=== PyBrain ===
[http://pybrain.org/docs/quickstart/installation.html Here] you would find the steps to install the PyBrain library.<br/>
We preferred the zip version to compile the code. Got some error with g++<br/>
Here is the error looks like --<br/>
`distutils.errors.CompileError: command 'g++' failed with exit status 1`<br/>
<br/>
Exact details of the error are --<br/>
`arac/src/c/layers/common.c: In function ‘void make_layer(Layer*, int, int)’:
arac/src/c/layers/common.c:12: error: ‘malloc’ was not declared in this scope
arac/src/c/layers/common.c: In function ‘Layer* make_layer(int, int)’:
arac/src/c/layers/common.c:40: error: ‘malloc’ was not declared in this scope`
<br/><br/>

So, got the patch [http://mglab.blogspot.com/2009/03/pythonpybrain-0.html here]. Its in Japanese and was not getting translated. But, i guess the solution was pretty simple so my very good friends knightsamar phrased it out... ;) Kudos to you. Here is what he did.<br/>
 * open this file in the extracted folder - arac/src/c/common.h
 * insert `#include<stdlib.h>` in the file and save it.
 * `sudo python setup.py build` and then `sudo python setup.py install`
The same steps are available at that Japanese site.
