Following software have been installed for setting up the server environment. The server environment is Linux based.
1. [http://www.python.org/download/ Python 2.5]<br/>
2. [http://www.nltk.org/download Natural Language Toolkit]<br/>
3. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy NumPy] - Numerical Python adds a fast and sophisticated array facility to the Python language. NumPy is the most recent and most actively supported package.<br/>
4. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/ MatPlotLib] - Matplotlib is a pure python plotting library with the goal of making publication quality plots using a syntax familiar to matlab users. The library uses numpy for handling large data sets and supports a variety of output backends<br/>
5. [http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/ Prover9] - Prover9 is an automated theorem prover for first-order and equational logic, and Mace4 searches for finite models and counter examples.


----
=== Python 2.5 ===
One can compile the source code for Python 2.5. For debian systems, type following command<br/>

`sudo apt-get install python`<br/>



=== Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) ===
Obtain the zip file from [http://nltk.googlecode.com/files/nltk-0.9.8.zip here]. Extract and install the toolkit by running `setup.py`



=== NumPy - ===
`sudo apt-get install python-numpy` -- debian based systems<br/>
Download and compile the tar.gz for others



=== MatPlotLib ===
`sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib` -- debian based systems<br/>
Download and compile the tar.gz for others.


=== Prover9 ===
`sudo apt-get install prover9` -- debian based systems<br/>
Download the tar.gz [http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Emccune/prover9/gui/p9m4-v05.tar.gz here] and compile it.
